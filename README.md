# NIRScanNano_Android-master

we have built our back-end program on the university server. We develop this Android smartphone 
application as the front-end program to allow end-users to interact with the NIRS device. The application 
provides a single interaction point. Besides, it provides the user with instructions and warnings 
regarding scan quality issues in order to reduce the effect of user-induced errors. The software also 
automates and encapsulates all the complex analysis stages, thus making the non-expert users scan, operate 
and understand the NIRS easily. Our application is developed based on the open-source project provided by KS
Technologies.
